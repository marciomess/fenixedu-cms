There are two types of site builder, the first is the most basic one and only supports default settings. The other one is System Builders and support content initialization.

The System Builders content initialization is setup on the code base, nevertheless the default settings can still be changed as required.

### **Existing sites**

Sites created with a specific builder keep a connection to the respective builder, but changes to the builder do not affect sites that have already been created.
