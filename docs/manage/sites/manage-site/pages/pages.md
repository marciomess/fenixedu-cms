# [Pages](./pages.md)

There are two different modes to edit pages.

+ A basic interface where the page only contains a single static post, and is possible to edit the post content directly
+ An advanced interface where it is possible to set the page components, for example to a list of posts.

Only pages that contain a single static post will be shown, when viewing the simplified list.

When the page is created you will be redirected to the edit pages interface.

## Edit Page

Each page has three content fields, the title, the body and the excerpt, with all being editable.

The page excerpt is a small text to be shown in a list view of the site pages, so it should be only a small description of the page contents.
