# [Search](search.md)

There are two ways to search for a site:

+ Using tags
+ Text query

It is also possible to combine both searches to give more specific results.

### Tags

On the drop down select the tag that you are searching for.

### Text query

The query that you input in the text field will be matched against the site title, site description, relative url and the site creator.

The resulting list will contain all sites that match your query, including those that only match it partially.
